Yet Another Frontend Framework
====
This repository is a compilation of useful resources for web application development. It contains our own additions and modifications to the well-known G5 framework (http://framework.gregbabula.info/). This framework is NOT an alternative to others web application frameworks like GWT, Sencha or Vaadin. It has been conceived precisely for those cases where a rich web application is needed but the behaviour of the applications still resemble a traditional Web site.
